            javaBin is open to anyone who wants to become a member. Every membership supports the Java community 
            in Norway and helps us to organize various events throughout the year, including JavaZone.

            How much does a membership cost?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Membership in javaBin is included in the JavaZone ticket, so if you have bought a ticket to JavaZone or have received this
            from your employer, then you are already a member of javaBin for that year. If you are not going to JavaZone, you can 
            buy a separate 12-month membership for 600 NOK.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students with a valid student ID can apply for free membership. If you are interested in a student membership, please 
            send an email to <a href="mailto:medlemskap@java.no">medlemskap@java.no</a>.
        </p>
